* if only one non-dotfile file exists in a repo, edit that file instead of running dired
* way to set which identity (git-ssh, github user) to use for access
* better error handling
* convert rest of functions (and gist.el) to v3 API
* setting description on gist

Investigate:

* setting file types automatic or manual?
* global keystroke or menu item?

DONE:

* if repo is not owned by current user, first fork it and edit *that* gist
